# Minimum Operations

## Algorithm

Initialize a variable `operations_counter` to 0, a variable `current_counter` to 1, and a variable `clipboard` to 0.
    While current_counter is less than or equal to n, do the following:
    a. If n is divisible by `current_counter`, then set clipboard to `current_counter` and divide n by `current_counter`.
    b. Otherwise, increment `current_counter` by 1 and continue.
    c. If clipboard is not 0, then increment operations by 2 (one operation to copy and one operation to paste) and set `current_counter` to clipboard.
    d. Set clipboard to 0 and continue.
    Return the value of operations.

In this algorithm, we iterate over all possible divisors of n and check if n is divisible by the current divisor `current_counter`. If n is divisible, we set `clipboard` to the value of `current_counter` and divide `n` by `current_counter`. We then increment `operations_counter` by 2 (one operation to copy and one operation to paste) and set `current_counter` to `clipboard`. We repeat this process until `current_counter` is greater than `n`.

This algorithm works because it identifies the smallest factor of n and divides n by that factor to obtain a quotient, which can be generated by copying and pasting the factor a certain number of times. We then repeat this process on the quotient until the desired number of H characters is reached. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) since we iterate over all possible divisors up to the square root of n.
